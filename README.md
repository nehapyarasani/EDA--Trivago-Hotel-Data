# Trivago Hotel Data Scraping & Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **scraping hotel data from Trivago** and performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about hotel prices, ratings, reviews, and location trends.  

The main goals are:
- Collect structured hotel data (name, price, rating, reviews, distance, region).
- Clean and preprocess scraped data for analysis.
- Perform **multivariate analysis** (price vs ratings vs distance).
- Visualize patterns with histograms, KDE plots, and scatter plots.
- Identify hidden trends and correlations for hotel selection & pricing insights.
